Supply chain simulation for disruptions
This is based on Jay Forrester's classic simulation exercise at MIT that continues to be the classic demonstration of the "Bullwhip Effect" of disruptions on a supply chain with information delays.
The simulation is built on python3 with streamlit as interface.
